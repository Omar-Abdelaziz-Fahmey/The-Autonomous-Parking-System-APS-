# The Autonomous Parking System (APS)

## Overview
The Autonomous Parking System (APS) is a project that aims to automate the process of parking vehicles. It uses an Atmega32 microcontroller to control the system.

## Features
- **Autonomous Control**: The system can automatically control the parking process, reducing the need for human intervention.
- **Atmega32 Microcontroller**: The APS uses the Atmega32 microcontroller, a powerful and versatile chip that can handle a wide range of tasks.

## Hardware Requirements
- Atmega32 microcontroller
- Sensors for detecting obstacles and vacant parking spaces
- Actuators for controlling the vehicle's movement

## Software Requirements
- Code for controlling the Atmega32 microcontroller
- Algorithms for detecting obstacles and vacant parking spaces
- Algorithms for controlling the vehicle's movement

## Installation
1. Set up the hardware as per the hardware requirements.
2. Upload the code to the Atmega32 microcontroller.
3. Test the system in a controlled environment before deploying it in a real-world scenario.

## Usage
Once the system is installed and set up, it can be used to automatically park vehicles in designated parking spaces.
